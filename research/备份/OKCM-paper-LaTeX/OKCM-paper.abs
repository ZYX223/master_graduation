Job scheduling is becoming increasingly important in large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) systems as the parallel scale, number and types of jobs continue to increase. Job-priority policies and backfilling mechanisms are the most useful practice for improving scheduling performance. Especially, job runtime is an important element in these methods, and precise knowledge of this parameter can significantly improve the system performance. Previous studies and models have focused only on improving accuracy, resulting in higher computational and time overhead and difficulties in real-time scheduling system deployment. Thus, an efficient runtime prediction model, referred to as online learning and K-nearest neighbors based (KNN-based) predictor with correction mechanism (OKCM), is proposed. OKCM updates in real time through online learning and is friendly to new users and users with a small data accumulation, owing to the KNN-based predictor. Whatâ€™ s more, OKCM guarantees safe execution of jobs through the correction mechanism. To evaluate our model, we designed and implemented a trace-driven simulator, HPCsim, based on real job workloads. The results demonstrated that OKCM can achieve high accuracy, up to 82.3\%, with a low overhead. Furthermore, OKCM can achieve significant scheduling performance improvements and can be used to enhance primary prioritizing and backfilling methods without scheduling limitations.
